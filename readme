A tool that will analyze my tweets from a given year, find the most commonly used tags and then create stats for those.

currently planned: 

get twitter archive.
create a db with tags and their frequencies.
find a way to display the tweets in a page.

future:

eventually it will be a live feed of all stats with latest tweets and link to all tweets in the year so far.
